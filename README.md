# Crop-Recommendation-System
**Overview**

This project involves the development and deployment of a robust crop recommendation system designed to optimize agricultural profitability by considering essential factors such as nutrient levels and environmental conditions. The system leverages various machine learning algorithms to enhance crop recommendations, providing valuable insights into their applications in agriculture.

**Features**

**User Input: **
Users can input values for Nitrogen (mg), Phosphorus (mg), Potassium (mg), Temperature (C), Humidity (%), pH (3-11), and Rainfall (mm).
Crop Prediction: Based on the provided inputs, the model predicts the most suitable crop to be planted.
**Data Analysis:** Includes analysis of essential nutrient levels and environmental conditions to maximize crop yield and profitability.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains the following columns:

_Nitrogen (mg):_ Amount of nitrogen in the soil._
Phosphorus (mg):_ Amount of phosphorus in the soil.
_Potassium (mg):_ Amount of potassium in the soil.
_Temperature (C):_ Ambient temperature.
_Humidity (%): _Humidity level in the air.
_pH (3-11):_ pH level of the soil.
_Rainfall (mm): _Amount of rainfall.
_Label:_ The crop that should be planted.

**Model**
The crop recommendation system uses various machine learning algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes and scikit-learn, to predict the most suitable crop based on the input parameters.

**Results**
**Profit Optimization: **The system helps in optimizing the profitability by recommending crops that are best suited for the given soil and environmental conditions.
**Insights:** The model provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning in agriculture, helping to improve crop yield and overall agricultural productivity.
